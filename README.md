[Vega](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~jbarbic/vega/) is a computationally efficient and stable C/C++ physics library for three-dimensional deformable object simulation. It is designed to model large
deformations, including geometric and material nonlinearities, and can also efficiently simulate linear systems. Vega is open-source and free. It is released under the 3-clause BSD license, which means that it can be used both in academic research and in commercial applications.

This inofficial fork of Vega adds a [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build setup.
